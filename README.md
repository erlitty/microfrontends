# Overview
This is a repo for a currently unnamed project that I am working on for fun. It will be mainly Typescript React.

Note the `packages` directory, this is where most of the code lies. There is an `application` package, which holds the client code, and a `react-components` package, which holds (you guessed it) the react components.

# How to run locally

`yarn bootstrap`

`yarn build`

`yarn start`

Open `https://localhost:8081`
